## AOMIC: the Amsterdam Open MRI Collection

AOMIC is a set of publicly available MRI datasets acquired at the Spinoza Centre (location REC), University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At the moment, we're finalizing the data curation process and we aim to release the data on [openneuro.org](openneuro.org) before the end of the year. For now, you can learn more about the collection in our [CCN](ccneuro.org) submission ([download](AOMIC_CCN2019.pdf)).
